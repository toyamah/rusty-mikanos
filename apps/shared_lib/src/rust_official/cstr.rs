/// Representation of a borrowed C string.
///
/// This type represents a borrowed reference to a nul-terminated
/// array of bytes. It can be constructed safely from a <code>&[[u8]]</code>
/// slice, or unsafely from a raw `*const c_char`. It can then be
/// converted to a Rust <code>&[str]</code> by performing UTF-8 validation, or
/// into an owned [`CString`].
///
/// `&CStr` is to [`CString`] as <code>&[str]</code> is to [`String`]: the former
/// in each pair are borrowed references; the latter are owned
/// strings.
///
/// Note that this structure is **not** `repr(C)` and is not recommended to be
/// placed in the signatures of FFI functions. Instead, safe wrappers of FFI
/// functions may leverage the unsafe [`CStr::from_ptr`] constructor to provide
/// a safe interface to other consumers.
