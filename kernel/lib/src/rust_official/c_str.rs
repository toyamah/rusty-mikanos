/// A type representing an owned, C-compatible, nul-terminated string with no nul bytes in the
/// middle.
///
/// This type serves the purpose of being able to safely generate a
/// C-compatible string from a Rust byte slice or vector. An instance of this
/// type is a static guarantee that the underlying bytes contain no interior 0
/// bytes ("nul characters") and that the final byte is 0 ("nul terminator").
///
/// `CString` is to <code>&[CStr]</code> as [`String`] is to <code>&[str]</code>: the former
/// in each pair are owned strings; the latter are borrowed
/// references.
///
/// # Creating a `CString`
///
/// A `CString` is created from either a byte slice or a byte vector,
/// or anything that implements <code>[Into]<[Vec]<[u8]>></code> (for
/// example, you can build a `CString` straight out of a [`String`] or
/// a <code>&[str]</code>, since both implement that trait).
///
/// The [`CString::new`] method will actually check that the provided <code>&[[u8]]</code>
/// does not have 0 bytes in the middle, and return an error if it
/// finds one.
///
/// # Extracting a raw pointer to the whole C string
///
/// `CString` implements an [`as_ptr`][`CStr::as_ptr`] method through the [`Deref`]
/// trait. This method will give you a `*const c_char` which you can
/// feed directly to extern functions that expect a nul-terminated
/// string, like C's `strdup()`. Notice that [`as_ptr`][`CStr::as_ptr`] returns a
/// read-only pointer; if the C code writes to it, that causes
/// undefined behavior.
///
/// # Extracting a slice of the whole C string
///
/// Alternatively, you can obtain a <code>&[[u8]]</code> slice from a
/// `CString` with the [`CString::as_bytes`] method. Slices produced in this
/// way do *not* contain the trailing nul terminator. This is useful
/// when you will be calling an extern function that takes a `*const
/// u8` argument which is not necessarily nul-terminated, plus another
/// argument with the length of the string — like C's `strndup()`.
/// You can of course get the slice's length with its
/// [`len`][slice::len] method.
///
/// If you need a <code>&[[u8]]</code> slice *with* the nul terminator, you
/// can use [`CString::as_bytes_with_nul`] instead.
///
/// Once you have the kind of slice you need (with or without a nul
/// terminator), you can call the slice's own
/// [`as_ptr`][slice::as_ptr] method to get a read-only raw pointer to pass to
/// extern functions. See the documentation for that function for a
/// discussion on ensuring the lifetime of the raw pointer.

/// `CString` is intended for working with traditional C-style strings
